During my time at Stripe, I worked on launching the[ Instant Payout](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts/instant-payouts) product to millions of merchants. Although my focus was software engineering, I wore different hats including talking to users, coming up with design solutions, shipping and A/B testing.

During my time at Stripe, I worked on launching the[ Instant Payout](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts/instant-payouts) product to millions of merchants. Although my focus was software engineering, I wore different hats including talking to users, coming up with design solutions, shipping and A/B testing.

## üßê Problem Space

Instant Payout was a product first launched to support [connected accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/instant-payouts), who mainly use Stripe via APIs. 

In 2019, our team led an effort to roll out Instant Payout to more eligible users for faster payouts. Among the targeted users, many of them use Stripe **dashboard**. 

So we built a instant payout flow for them on the dashboard. As we built out the instant payout flow on the dashboard, we came up with various solutions to increase the adoption rate of the new product.

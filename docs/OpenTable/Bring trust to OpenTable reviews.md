## Problem Statement

> There's a lack of credibility and trust in [OpenTable][opentable]'s review system. We want to bring trust into ratings and reviews. 

## Understand the problem

Given the problem statement :material-information-outline:{ title="The problem prompt was given to students for learing by Memorisely." }, we still think it's useful to do research to back the statement with data and gather insights to answer the following questions: 

  [opentable]: https://www.opentable.com/  "an online restaurant reservation service to book tables, view menus, and read reviews"


- [What is the current state of the review system?](#what-is-the-current-state-of-the-review-system)
- [Why is the problem worth solving?](#why-is-the-problem-worth-solving)
-  How can we come up with a solution that would be meaningful to the business?
-  How will we measure success?

### What is the current state of the review system?
#### How does the review system work?
According to OpenTable's guidelines, its review system requires users to have a reservation at a restaurant in order to leave a review.

ðŸŸ¢ only diners can leave review <br>
ðŸŸ¢ all reviews (positive or negative) will be published <br>
That sounds promising from platform's perspective, and...

#### What's the diners' perceptions?

</figure>

From the diners' perspective: <br>
ðŸ¤¨  they are skeptical of who's behind the reviews.<br>
ðŸ˜¡  restaurants can leave "fake" reviews by registering as a diner. <br>

### Why is the problem worth solving?

#### Scale
OpenTable generates millions of reviews every month and takes pride in the fact that the reviews are all from verified users. An improvement on reviews would elevate millons' booking and dining experiences and shape their relationships with OpenTable.

#### Impact
Trust and fairness on reviews is crucial to OpenTable retaining and acquiring users ( both diners and restaurants). Paying attention and investing in trust in reviews also aligns with OpenTable's mission:

>helping restaurants of **all sizes** thrive, to enabling diners to **find and book the perfect table for every occasion**, our story is one of **human connectionâ€”among diners and restaurants, and between restaurants and their communities**.

Trust and fairness are the cornerstones of genuine and meaningful relationships.

#### Consequences of inaction
- Users will leave the platform for competitors for insights and reviews.
- Smaller restaurant would opt for other platform for fairness.

## User Research
### Usability Testing


### Competitor Analysis






What gives Opentable edge is its review system powered by direct customer input. The review system serves a few parties:
1. Customers use reviews to make informed decisions about which restaurants to visit next.
2. Restaurants gain insights and constructive feedback on how to improve their system from the data.
3. The platform leverage the data insights to promote and rank restaurants that are highly rated - kicking off a healthy and organic competition in the marketplace. 
### What 
In this redesign project, we are focusing on making the reviews more trustworthy for the diners. By improving the review system, customers will make better decisions and feel good about their decisions. It will create a product stickiness. With network effect, Opentable will gain organic traction of new users and anticipate growth in bookings and revenues.

> By letting reviewers add identity-descriptive information (e.g., name, geographic location or profile picture) to their reviews, system designers can support reviewers in improving their trustworthiness and thus increase the perceived helpfulness of their reviews ([Forman et al., 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963868717302263#b0225),Â [Karimi and Wang, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963868717302263#b0360)) [Review Presentation]. Another way of increasing the perceived helpfulness of reviews involves awarding badges or certificates to reputable reviewers ([Kuan et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963868717302263#b0390),Â [Chang and Wu, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963868717302263#b0095),Â [Chang et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963868717302263#b0100)) [Reviewer Reputation].

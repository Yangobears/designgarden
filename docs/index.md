👋 I am Yan, nice to meet you!

Welcome to my design portfolio where I present my case studies and share my learnings on design. 

### My journey to design

Prior to becoming a designer, I've worked as a **software engineer** in companies such as [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and [Flexport](https://www.flexport.com/). During my time there, I have worked on shipping products that serve millions of users and building apps from zero to one.

In 2022, I moved to NY to pursue my interests in **illustration** and studied briefly at the [School of Visual Arts](https://sva.edu/). That experience, as well as my time away from work, has led me to realize that my true interest lies in the intersection of human psychology, technology and visual communication. 

Fast forward to now - I am excited to find my next opportunity as a **product designer** and work along with brilliant minds to solve problems and create magic together!

### Why design?

>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. The only way to do great work is to **love what you do**. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.
  
  -- Steve Jobs in the [2005 Stanford Commencement Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc)

I am a firm believer on loving what you do and I see work as an integral part of a fulfilling life. 

I like both engineering and illustration, but I wouldn't call them what I love to do.

Design fascinates me as it combines various disciplines, such as critical thinking, psychology, human behavior, technology, business and visual communication, which all align with my innate interests. 

Why design? Honestly, I am not sure if it's THE work I am looking for - only time and experience could tell. However, at the moment, the direction feels right and I will let my curiosity and intuition lead the way.

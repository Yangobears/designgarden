I am [Yan](www.yanyanleee.com)! Welcome to my digital garden where I document and share my learnings on becoming a better designer and human.

## Intention

This site is created to help with my constant frustration while learning:

> How do I retain knowledge and make sure I am actually learning?

To fight against information overload, I've decided to consume with intention and focus. True learning is a balanced act between inputting and outputting. I am starting this space to capture, organize, synthesize and share what I have been reading, listening, watching and thinking. 

## Principles
Reminder to self on how I tend to grow this digital garden.
### Have fun
Writing and learning in public means you need to be aware of your audience. 
While the number rule of starting a blog is to know your audience and speak to them, I also want this to be a documentary of my growth and learnings. I will add in personal anecdote

Being a visual communicator at heart, I intend to supplement notes with illustrations and diagrams at times.

### Do it *every day*.

### Done is better than perfect. 
While I intend to become a better writer through this project, I want to remind myself the priority here is to share knowledge rather than to write perfectly. 



## About the site

### How I build this site

The site is made possible by these amazing and _free_ softwares:

- [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown): A lightweight markup language that is used to format text documents. It's usually used for software documentations. I found it simple yet expressive for creating text-based content.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - a note-taking and personal knowledge management application that allows users to create and organize notes and ideas in _Markdown_. Obsidian has also built a wonderful community over the year - there are many helpful plugins and toolings just like Figma.
- [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), an open-source framework that turns _Markdown_ Docs into simple yet powerful site like this one. I am drawn to using this particular framework for its [philosophy](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/philosophy/). Truth to be told, I probably spent way too much time attempting to design and build this site from scratch at first. This framework is a godsend -- reminding me of why I am doing this project in the first place and empowering me to focus on what truly matters.

The process of creating notes is made super straightforward thanks to the above.

#### Initial set up

1. Follow the instructions [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) to create a repositary for your site.
2. Download Obsidian and make `docs/` your [vault](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Working+with+multiple+vaults).

#### Writing Process

1. Start the mkdocs server and open the browser for [live preview](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/#previewing-as-you-write).
2. Open Obsidian and write. When you create folders, those will default appear as navigations.
3. After you are done writing, [publish](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/) the site with automatic deploy.

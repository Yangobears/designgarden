## Why did I decide to take this course
From November 2022, I started taking a live bootcamp with [Memorisely](https://www.memorisely.com/) taught by the amazing [Zander](https://twitter.com/zander_supafast).  Truth to be told, I signed up for the class on a whim because I was drawn to Zander's energy and enthusiasm. Having a rather lackluster experience with [[Designlab]] previously, I realize the impact of having an inspiring mentor in my learning experience. I am inspired by people who care about their crafts - you can often tell from their attention to details and high standard on execution. Plus, they always seem like they are having so much fun! The love and passion about the subject matter is contagious. 


## Who I think is this course for
As of this writing, we are half way through the bootcamp and I am happy I made the investment to attend this class.

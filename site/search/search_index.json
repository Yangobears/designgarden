It's usually used for software documentations. I found it simple yet expressive for creating text-based content.</li> <li>Obsidian - a note-taking and personal knowledge management application that allows users to create and organize notes and ideas in Markdown. Obsidian has also built a wonderful community over the year - there are many helpful plugins and toolings just like Figma.</li> <li>Material for MkDocs, an open-source framework that turns Markdown Docs into simple yet powerful site like this one. I am drawn to using this particular framework for its philosophy. Truth to be told, I probably spent way too much time attempting to design and build this site from scratch at first. This framework is a godsend -- reminding me of why I am doing this project in the first place and empowering me to focus on what truly matters.</li> </ul> <p>The process of creating notes is made super straightforward thanks to the above.</p>"},{"location":"About/#initial-set-up","title":"Initial set up","text":"<ol> <li>Follow the instructions here to create a repositary for your site.</li> <li>Download Obsidian and make <code>docs/</code> your vault.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"About/#writing-process","title":"Writing Process","text":"<ol> <li>Start the mkdocs server and open the browser for live preview.</li> <li>Open Obsidian and write.

Truth to be told, I signed up for the class on a whim because I was drawn to Zander's energy and enthusiasm. Having a rather lackluster experience with Designlab previously, I realize the impact of having an inspiring mentor in my learning experience. I am inspired by people who care about their crafts - you can often tell from their attention to details and high standard on execution. Plus, they always seem like they are having so much fun!

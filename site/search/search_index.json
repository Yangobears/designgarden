Welcome to my digital garden where I document and share my learnings on becoming a better designer and human. Intention This site is created to help with my biggest frustration while learning: How do I retain knowledge and make sure I am actually learning? To fight against information overload, I've decided to consume with intention and focus. True learning is a balanced act between inputting and outputting. I am starting this space to capture, organize, synthesize and share what I have been reading, listening, watching and thinking. Non goals While I intend to become a better writer through this project, I want to remind myself the priority here is to share knowledge rather than to write perfectly. Also, being a visual communicator at heart, I intend to supplement notes with illustrations and diagrams at times. About the site How I build this site The site is made possible by these amazing and free softwares: Markdown : A lightweight markup language that is used to format text documents. It's usually used for software documentations. I found it simple yet expressive for creating text-based content. Obsidian - a note-taking and personal knowledge management application that allows users to create and organize notes and ideas in Markdown . Obsidian has also built a wonderful community over the year - there are many helpful plugins and toolings just like Figma. Material for MkDocs , an open-source framework that turns Markdown Docs into simple yet powerful site like this one. I am drawn to using this particular framework for its philosophy . Truth to be told, I probably spent way too much time attempting to design and build this site from scratch at first. This framework is a godsend -- reminding me of why I am doing this project in the first place and empowering me to focus on what truly matters. The process of creating notes is made super straightforward thanks to the above. Initial set up Follow the instructions here to create a repositary for your site. Download Obsidian and make docs/ your vault . Writing Process Start the mkdocs server and open the browser for live preview . Open Obsidian and write. When you create folders, those will default appear as navigations. After you are done writing, publish the site with automatic deploy.","title":"Hello"},{"location":"#hello","text":"I am Yan !

## What's missing from OpenTable?

When you know exactly where to eat, OpenTable seems to work perfectly: search, book and you are all set.

However, when you are still on the fence about a place or are in the mood for something new, does OpenTable help with your decision?

**Consider the following scenario**s

>Kim is frustrated with the mixed reviews on a dim sum place she found on OpenTable. **She opens Yelp for more detailed reviews from Yelp elites**. After seeing approvals from reviewers who frequented dim sum, she felt assured and books from there. 

---

>Sam is planning to reserve early on OpenTable for Valentines day. Before booking, he wants to find a place that will impress his date. He sees **a curated list on The Infatuation written by an expert food editor** and calls the restaurant directly from there. 

---

> Salina is travelling to NYC with his family for the first time. The family members have specific dietary restrictions. Unsatisfied with the search from reviews, **she turns to TripAdvisor's forum for specific asks** and books following a recommended link.

What's happening here?

OpenTable 
1. is the only site that guarantee reviews are from the diners.
2. usually has more reviews than the other sites for a given restaurant.

Given OpenTable's unique offering and competitive edge, 

>Why do users turn away and choose to trust reviews elsewhere instead?

All of these users would have potentially booked more tables with OpenTable, but they turned to alternatives for *authority*, *quality* and *community*. 

>What's missing from OpenTable is its lack of human touch behind each reviews. 

Not only is the lack of personal identity causing missed opportunties on bookings, it's also hurting its branding and reputation. A simple search online surfaced multiple users' concerns on the authenticity and fairness of its review system.

There is a clear gap between OpenTable's investment around reviews and diners' perception of the system.

## Draft

With the problem statement :material-information-outline:{ title="The problem prompt was given to students for learing by Memorisely." }, we did research to understand the problem space with data and gather insights to answer the following questions:

[opentable]: https://www.opentable.com/ "an online restaurant reservation service to book tables, view menus, and read reviews"

- [What is the current state of the review system?](#what-is-the-current-state-of-the-review-system)
- [Why is the problem worth solving?](#why-is-the-problem-worth-solving)
- How can we come up with a solution that would be meaningful to the business?
- How will we measure success?

### Current state

#### OpenTable's Promises

According to OpenTable's guidelines, its review system requires users to have a reservation at a restaurant in order to leave a review.

<figure markdown>

  <figcaption>From OpenTable's <a href="https://help.opentable.com/s/article/Ratings-and-Reviews-1505261056054?language=en_US#A3">guideline</a></figcaption>
</figure>

!!! tip "OpenTable: trust us, we guarantee the reviews are real."

    	- Only diners can leave review
        - All compliant reviews (positive or negative) will be published

That sounds promising from platform's perspective, so why is there an underlying issue with trust?

#### Diners' perceptions

<figure markdown>
  ![Image title](../assets/opentable_complaints.png)
  <figcaption>Users' views from <a href="https://www.inside-las-vegas.com/1602/You-Cant-Trust-OpenTable-Reviews">a dedicated blog post</a> and <a href="https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/opentable.com">a review site</a></figcaption>
</figure>

From the diners' perspective:

!!! danger "Diners: we are not sure, tell us who's posting those reviews. "

    - who know's who is posting those reviews.
    - restaurants can leave "fake" reviews by registering as a diner.

## User Impact

#### Scale

OpenTable generates millions of reviews every month and takes pride in the fact that the reviews are all from verified users. An improvement on reviews would elevate millons' booking and dining experiences and shape their relationships with OpenTable.



#### Impact

Trust and fairness on reviews is crucial to OpenTable retaining and acquiring users ( both diners and restaurants). Paying attention and investing in trust in reviews also aligns with OpenTable's mission:

> helping restaurants of **all sizes** thrive, to enabling diners to **find and book the perfect table for every occasion**, our story is one of **human connection—among diners and restaurants, and between restaurants and their communities**.

Trust and fairness are the cornerstones of genuine and meaningful relationships.

What gives Opentable edge is its review system powered by direct customer input. The review system serves a few parties:

1. Customers use reviews to make informed decisions about which restaurants to visit next.
2. Restaurants gain insights and constructive feedback on how to improve their system from the data.
3. The platform leverage the data insights to promote and rank restaurants that are highly rated - kicking off a healthy and organic competition in the marketplace.

#### Consequences of inaction

- Users will leave the platform for competitors for insights and reviews.
- Smaller restaurant would opt for other platform for fairness.

## Business Metrics


!!! note "Problem Statement"

    [OpenTable](https://www.opentable.com), a popular online restaurant-reservation service, have amassed millions of reviews but **failed to build consumers' trust in their informativeness** and authenticity**.

## User Research

### Usability Review & Competitor Benchmarking

To emphasize with diners, we decided to check out OpenTable and its competitors.

Comparing OpenTable side by side with TripAdvisor gave us insights and inspirations on how the review system could be improved. It also make us wonder the intentionality behind certain design choices.

<figure markdown>

  <figcaption>Usability review and competitor benchmarking </figcaption>
</figure>

!!! tip "Wow moments" - Breakdowns on overall rating scores. - The workflow to search and sort reviews are intuitive. - One-click feedback for individual reviews.

!!! danger "Pain points" - Lack of credibility on user profile: - Lack of real photos. - Unclickable profiles. - Inconsistency information displayed across users. - Inability to search and filter from the restaurant home page. - Privacy concerns surrounding the exposure of diners' exact dining dates if identities were to be revealed.

!!! warning "Huh?" - What does the date displayed indicate? Was it dining date or posting date? - Why is the `number of reviews` displayed on with users but not the others - What's the difference between users named `OpenTable Diner` and say `KateH`?

### Learn from the experts

### Ideation

####

In this redesign project, we are focusing on making the reviews more trustworthy for the diners. By improving the review system, customers will make better decisions and feel good about their decisions. It will create a product stickiness. With network effect, Opentable will gain organic traction of new users and anticipate growth in bookings and revenues.

> By letting reviewers add identity-descriptive information (e.g., name, geographic location or profile picture) to their reviews, system designers can support reviewers in improving their trustworthiness and thus increase the perceived helpfulness of their reviews ([Forman et al., 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963868717302263#b0225), [Karimi and Wang, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963868717302263#b0360)) [Review Presentation]. Another way of increasing the perceived helpfulness of reviews involves awarding badges or certificates to reputable reviewers ([Kuan et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963868717302263#b0390), [Chang and Wu, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963868717302263#b0095), [Chang et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963868717302263#b0100)) [Reviewer Reputation].

## when i get on OpenTable and decide if I want to eat somewhere

The problem:
lack of trust in informativeness and accuracy of the reviews

OpenTable's edge: all the reviews are written by diners and are verified.

work backwards:
storytelling / user journey

- you opened OpenTable to look for a place - you want to see what's popular among friends - since you want to book a place that can accomodate your friends despite the rating being low
- you click on the top recommended restaurant
- you see a section of what your networks are saying - seems like a solid choice
- you got a message asking you to search for ""
- there's no friends review, so you choose to sort the reviews by usefulness
- you really like the top reviewers' review, you are curious and click on their profile, you realize you have **mutual friends** and **mutual restaurant collections**
- you decided to follow them
- you got a notification they accepted your followings, and they started follow you.
- pop up - get notified on where friends' are eating? - notificaiton -> open app more..
-

- instagram

testing script/ scenarios

**What business metrics we want to move?**
Revenue: # of bookings on OpenTable
Frequency of using the app
Time from checking to booking
Time spent on looking at reviews
**What user behavior could move the metrics?**
User received a notification, open app and start browsing restaurants
User spending less time on looking at reviews before booking
**How can we design the product in a way that would possibly move the metrics?**
Notify users on friends' activity
Reward users' behavior in review
What's the mvp we can ship to verifiy ^ ?
After shipping, does the change cause user behavior?
Does the user behavior move business metrics?
